For extended Euclid:
1a) a= 24563, b= 41451
    a=34563 b=41451 d=123 x=6 y=-5

1b) a = 41451 b=34563 
    a=41451 b=34563 d=123 x=-5 y=6

    A and B are related because gcd(a,b) = 1 = a*x + b*y
				gcd(b,a) = 1 = b*x + a*y
				since addition is associtive
				switching a and b in this formular
				just switches the position as you 
				can see above.
