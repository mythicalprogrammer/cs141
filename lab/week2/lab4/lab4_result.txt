2)
Huffman encoding yield the highest compression on fun.txt. 
Apparently huffman encoding works for small txt files but I can't really say if
huffman works because I don't know if our program have including
the huffman dictionary to figure out for example 1100 represent A.

3)
Yes this is always optimal because always prefix but... apparently there are
better encoding. 

4)Base on the result I believe pdf have more hidden information that's probably
  why huffman only encoded 10% compare to 20% on the other two. I also
  think that pdf tries to compress too in it native format.

5)It indicate that the more characters there are then the average length will 
  bigger and huffman will be more inefficient. I cannot say how the other
  compress formats work.

6) a) Yes I would because it compress anyway even if their compress can be 
      really really small because IT STILL COMPRESS compare to lossless
      files.
   b) I would compress small files because bigger file will increase
      the average length of bit.

7) There is no one best. Huffman is good for small files while bzip2 and other
   compress file are intended for compressing huge files.
